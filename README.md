# JSplit
A tool for splitting ndjson files into smaller chunks by uniqueness of a variable in the structure. Currently, this is unfinished and should not be used by anyone.

# Quickstart
```commandline
$ git clone https://github.com/brudihawo/jsplit
$ make
$ jsplit file.json [options] series of entries
```

# Roadmap
- [ ] actually make this damn thing work
- [ ] multithreaded processing / at least async writing
